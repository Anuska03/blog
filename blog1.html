    <i>If you still cry to sleep on those dark, scary, lonely nights, itâ€™s okay. Everybody has some fears; some fear love, some fear losing, some fear future, some fear past, some fear lie, some fear truth and some still fear catching feelings. Itâ€™s okay if you are someone they no longer love. It is also okay if itâ€™s too late. The right people will always find you at the right time. But most important is that you realise that you can be who YOU want. You can feel how YOU want. You can love whom YOU want, too. Itâ€™s okay. Toxic people do that to you. They break your fucking walls. They begin to suck the life out of you and everything you love about yourself without thinking twice. They begin to destroy. They begin to burn. They abuse you, mentally. Itâ€™s terrible I know but they do exist. And they run out of there like nothing has happened. BUT ITâ€™S OKAY! You still have a lot of love in you, even when you think youâ€™re done, thereâ€™s always a little more left. Itâ€™s okay to make mistakes. Itâ€™s okay to have bad days. Itâ€™s okay to not be okay. Itâ€™s okay to be YOURSELF.Heal, you can come out of it. It was not your fault , little one, I know you have hoped for so long. Maybe the journey right now is not about love, its not about you. Maybe this is the season to be your own saviour , to be your own safe place .Maybe the people who left your side , who walked away were ever only leading your back to lead you here. And here you are, OKAY on your own. Here you are rebuilding. Here you are adapting, mending , reclaiming all of the pieces you let them walk away with. Just here, be kinder to your soul. Nourish yourself. You are not depending on any other person to fix it. Here you are doing that on your own. Here you are healing.Healing is very difficult. But itâ€™s okay to let them go . Its okay to move on. Try a little harder each day. Thatâ€™s all you can do. Take it day by day. You can decide to override your mind, bet on yourself, and make a brand new pathway in your life to move towards a life you really want. You once had high walls, remember there was a reason for it. Rebuild them.Healing is different for everyone. Some read and heal, while some listen to the music of their choice for their journey . Some eat, sleep and repeat, some meditate, while some do all of it togther. Itâ€™s just they try. Just love the colour of your eyes, your skintone, follow your passions, love you weaknesses and your strengths. Give yourself some credit. You pushed through the mess, you dug yourself out of hurt. Sometimes you just have to focus on what you have around and stop chasing the ones who donâ€™t give a fuck about you. See and feel how blessed you are. How could you think youâ€™re weak? when everytime you fell you came back stronger than before.Just do not be hard on yourself. Be tender. Be gentle. Everything will be okay. I know one day youâ€™ll also sayâ€“  ITâ€™S O.K.A.Y. ðŸ™‚</h4></i>
